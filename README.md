# ROS-TIS-GigE-Camera-Node
Original ROS node camera_aravis
http://http://wiki.ros.org/camera_aravis

This is an attempt to implement an Imaging Source GigE camera as a ROS node
by updating and old node written for ROS Hydro that uses an outdated version of Aravis.

Current version uses ROS Kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04.
Aravis v0.4.1
